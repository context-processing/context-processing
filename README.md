# context-processing
context-proccessing text processing tokenizer, normalizer, stope word removal , stemmer, lemmatize. 


the program would take these three files:

amazon_cells_labelled.txt

imdb_labelled.txt

yelp_labelled.txt


and would retrive 3 .csv file as an output 

in each output there is strig contains 0 and 1 for each word in the vocabulary wordlist  wich means that this word exist int ith sentence or not.

I also upload the .rar project file but just remember to add libraries!

these are libraries that i used :

edu.standford.nlp library

opennlp library

i optimized my code by writing just the 1 indes insted of 0 and 1 and it reduced my file size from 1500kb to 35 kb 

take a look at the optimezed.csv files
